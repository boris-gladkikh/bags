          Bags seeks to be a better built, more flexible print solution for bay
          area and west coast businesses. By utilizing various streams of
          revenue and partnerships with traditional print houses we can be more
          adaptable to the rapidly changing economic climate and provide a more
          thorough service to our customers.
